		<p>Ujjain Engineering College, Ujjain, was established in 1966 by the Government of Madhya Pradesh with the primary objective of enhancing technical education. Its mission was to produce well-qualified engineering graduates capable of driving the industrialization of the country forward. In its initial years, the college offered programs in just three engineering disciplines: Civil, Mechanical, and Electrical.
			As the years passed and the demand for diverse engineering specializations grew, Ujjain Engineering College expanded its offerings. In 1985, the Electronics Engineering program was introduced, followed by Chemical Engineering in 1986. In 2001, the Computer Science and Engineering branch was added to keep up with the evolving technology landscape.
			Not limited to undergraduate programs, the college also offers Master's Degree courses in several engineering disciplines, including Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. This comprehensive approach to education ensures that students have opportunities for both specialized study and advanced research in their chosen fields.
			Throughout its history, Ujjain Engineering College has played a vital role in nurturing engineering talent, fostering innovation, and contributing to the socio-economic development of the region and the nation as a whole. It continues to uphold its commitment to delivering quality technical education and preparing future generations of engineers to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving world.</p>
